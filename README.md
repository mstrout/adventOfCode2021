day1a-countIncreases.chpl: count the number of times a depth measurement 
increases
- time 9:15am-9:33am

day1b-countIncreases.chpl: count how many windows of three increases
- time 10:00am-11am, this may have included about 20 minutes of making tea, etc.
- used classes and started MemManageConfusion/

day2-position.chpl: read commands that move the submarine
- time 11:16am-11:33am
- used a class, but didn't run into any issues
- part 2, started right away
- finished at 11:40

day3-binary.chpl: manipulating binary numbers read in as text
- time 11:45am, stopped at 12:18 because are internet is awful
- started again at 2:30pm (see MemManagementConfusion for compiler
  bug and generic type confusion
  stopping at 3:13, ran into all kinds of issues
  starting at 3:50 until 4:37

day4-bingo
- not going to do this one just yet.  Think I want a list of integers for
  the draws and a list of 2D arrays for the boards and don't really want 
  to use classes.

day5-grid of vents
- this one is also going to use 2D arrays

day6 is about the reproducing lattern fish, this can use a list of ints

day 7 is a little integer linear programming problem, can set up the
objective function and just compute it for the whole range of possible positions
and pick where the objective function is minimal.  Just need an array of ints
for this one.

day 8 is a puzzle about a broken decimal digit display

day 9 is a stencil computation, will use a 2D array

day 10 this one will need a stack, a counter, and a sum

day 11 is a stencil computation that will need to converge each "step"

day 12, a fun combinatoric paths over a graph problem, should I try to use
classes to make a graph data structure?

day 13, a 2D array folding one

day 14, string insertion, will probably use a list

day 15, another optimization one, but this one with a 2D array to keep track
of the map and the current path.  Do we want an array of class instances here?
Or maybe just an array of records?

day 16, an encoding and decoding one

day 17, computing trajectories

day 18, yep this one wants a tree
  - started at 8:09pm, stopped at 9:22
  LEFTOFF: have an example where I got stuck with shared SnailFishNode?
  unmanaged?  not do this with methods?
  - started at 3:57 stopped at 4:36, apparently forget how to do recursion
